            In order to improve people's living conditions, the level of education must be improved. This starts at a
            young age. Hence the decision to found a kindergarten. In 1981 this bungalow is rented. It can accommodate 4
            group rooms. In the beginning, 2 educators will be hired and trained. In the first quarter, 20 children
            register. In the second quarter there are already more than 40 children and 5 employees. The number of
            children is constantly growing. New teachers and other employees are hired. There is a lot to do â€“ in
